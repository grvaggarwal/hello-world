# hello-world

Hey!

With some (read minimal) experience in programming, I am making efforts to learn further about using platforms, observe how people code and learn through the process. I have basic experience with languages like Python, PERL, C, SAS and R. I am post graduate in Mathematics, a working professional in financial modelling. Hence the requirement to be comfortable with more elegant codes.

So here I am foraying into GitHub. :)
